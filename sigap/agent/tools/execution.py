"""Bram's tools (Execution).

The action record lives here, and this is the only file that writes outward to
SAP. Three guards here must not be removed:

  · idempotency, identical action content yields an identical key, so a retry
    never becomes a second purchase order;
  · the autonomy limit, above Rp 50 million an action waits for a human, and
    anything waiting never touches SAP;
  · no run, no row, because an action nobody can trace back to a handling is
    an action nobody can approve or refuse.

Recording an action is shared through `raise_action` rather than duplicated,
because a draft does not have to be raised by the agent that sends it onward.
Prita picks the supplier and raises the purchase order; Bram is the one who
takes an approved action to SAP. Both write the same record.
